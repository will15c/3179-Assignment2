        <p>The following is a proportional symbol map of all Tsunamis, from 1900 to now, that were caused by magnitude 8 or higher earthquakes. 
            Data was taken from https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/tsunami/event-search. Only those tsunamis with maximum water height data are shown.
